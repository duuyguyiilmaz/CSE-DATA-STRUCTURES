----------------LAB03 – LINKED LIST---------------------
This lab focuses on implementing linked list data structures from scratch in Java,
without using built-in collection classes.
------------ Implemented Structures
- Singly Linked List
- Circular Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
------------ Key Features
- Generic type support
- Index-based operations (`get`, `set`, `insertAt`, `removeAt`)
- Proper index validation with `IndexOutOfBoundsException`
- Null-safe search and removal operations
- Clean separation of list logic and node structures
- 
  -----------------Lab05 – RECURSION-------------------------  
  Recursive implementations of fundamental algorithms including factorial, array sum,
  power calculation, binary search, string reversal, Fibonacci sequence, tail recursion,
  and linked list operations.
