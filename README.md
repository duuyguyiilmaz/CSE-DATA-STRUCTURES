----------------LAB03 – LINKED LIST---------------------
This lab focuses on implementing linked list data structures from scratch in Java,
without using built-in collection classes.
------------ Implemented Structures
- Singly Linked List
- Circular Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
------------ Key Features
- Generic type support
- Index-based operations (`get`, `set`, `insertAt`, `removeAt`)
- Proper index validation with `IndexOutOfBoundsException`
- Null-safe search and removal operations
- Clean separation of list logic and node structures
- 
  -----------------Lab05 – RECURSION-------------------------  
  Recursive implementations of fundamental algorithms including factorial, array sum,
  power calculation, binary search, string reversal, Fibonacci sequence, tail recursion,
  and linked list operations.
  
----------------- Lab06 – STACK AND QUEUE IMPLEMENTATIONS---------------
ArrayStack is an array-based stack implementation that uses a top variable
to manage stack operations, allowing push, pop, and top operations to run
in constant time (O(1)).

ArrayQueue is a circular array-based queue implementation that maintains
front and size variables, enabling enqueue, dequeue, and front
operations to execute in constant time (O(1)).

LinkedStack and LinkedQueue are linked-list–based implementations where all
core operations run in constant time (O(1)), as elements are added or removed
directly from the head or tail without traversal.
